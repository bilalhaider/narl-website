Taking a lead from the One Belt One Road initiative, The China Pakistan Marine Information Workshop (CPMI) was held in Harbin Engineering University, China, with the aim to promote scientific research, training and collaboration between the two countries. This training workshop took place from November 2 – 10, 2019.

Mr. Muhammad Shabbir Hasan from LUMS participated in this workshop on behalf of the Centre for Water Informatics and Technology (WIT) and the University. Throughout the duration of this training workshop participants were exposed to innovative technology and techniques, paper presentations and lab sessions for practical demonstrations. Mr. Hasan witnessed the advanced research carried out in the domain of underwater acoustic technology. He aims to implement this new knowledge by tailoring it to the mapping canal’s and water ways without having to drain them completely.
