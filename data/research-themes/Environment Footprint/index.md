Water pollution is an added stress onthe availability of water foragricultural, industrial and urbanneeds. NARL initiatives aim toimprove water management throughmonitoring water quality and trashpollution in fresh water streams bydeploying articial intelligence andIoT backed sensor network acrossPakistan.Pakistanâ€™s forest cover area is only 5%of the total land area and underconstant threat with annualdeforestation rate of 1.5% due tourbanization and illegal logging. Thisis destroying habitat and leading tosoil erosion. At NARL, researchers aredeveloping knowledge managementdatabase system powered by IoT,remote sensing and articialintelligence to monitor our preciousforest resources and encourageevidence based decision making andreforestation techniques.
