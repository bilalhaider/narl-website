title: Water Quality Monitoring
tags: projects
layout: project
themes:
    - environment-footprint
sponsor: Punjab Irrigation Department, Nestle
duration: 3 Years
concept: In the absence of an effective trash management framework, trash is often illegally dumped in rivers and canals running through urban areas, contaminating freshwater and blocking drainage lines which results in urban floods. When this contaminated water reaches agricultural fields, it results in degradation of soil and poses critical environmental as well as economic threats. In this research, we aim to devise an automated vision based approach to detect, classify and quantify the trash present in canals and drains which would eventually assist the government and policymakers to take appropriate steps.
