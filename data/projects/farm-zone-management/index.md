Pakistan’s economy is heavily dependent on agriculture. Any poverty alleviation effort in Pakistan should come coupled with reforms in agriculture sector. NARL along with WIT and other concerned departments at LUMS, is putting efforts to bring improvement in agriculture sector with the help of prior knowledge and modern techniques. Farm zone management through scientific approach is one of NARL’s aims. It also aims to educate farmer community with latest tools and techniques to closely monitor agricultural fields.

LUMS nursery (4 kanals) has been selected for this purpose. Detailed soil analysis test has been conducted on selected field for Smart Agriculture Site. Climate smart agricultural field is being established to compare agricultural efficiency with traditional cropping techniques. Efficacy of Paradoxical Agriculture using precision tools in improving the life of farmer community, crop yields and soil health will be studied.

Real time monitoring will be ensured using weather station and different sensors. Soil Moisture Sensors will be used to monitor water conditions to improve water management in the field. NDVI of continuous time period is being used to monitor soil conditions. Knowledge from agriculture experts is collected and disseminated to farmer community for capacity building.
