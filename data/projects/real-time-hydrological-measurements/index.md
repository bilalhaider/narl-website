title: Real-time Hydrological Measurements
tags: projects
layout: project
themes:
    - water-efficiency
sponsor: Punjab Irrigation Department
duration: 3 Years
concept: The primary objective of this section is “to enable real-time hydrological measurements for achieving high efficiency irrigation systems”. This objective addresses the problem of lack of usable data to improve our water usage and management. The focus of this objective will be to monitor the specified hydrological channels across Pakistan with the aim to automate the old time-honored traditions of data collection and introduce state-of-the-art technological solutions that assist and leverage the human-effort of water management in our ever growing complex society of Pakistan.

#### Technologies:

##### Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring:

In developing countries wastewater from various sources such as domestic sewage, untreated industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and animal waste is usually dumped into surface water streams. This system is designed to monitor water quality at both open channels and closed conduits. It measures physicochemical parameters such as, pH, dissolved oxygen, electrical conductivity, oxidation-reduction potential, temperature and turbidity. The values are wirelessly transmitted to the server, after which they can be mapped to various graphs and plots. The collected data helps to investigate the effects of water parameters on agricultural soil, crop productivity and human health, in particular.

###### Water Quality Sensor
Sensors:
- pH
- Dissolved Oxygen – (mg/L )
- Oxidation Reduction Potential (mV)
- Electric Conductivity (uS/cm )
- Turbidity (NTU)
- Temperature

Design:
- Floating / Drifter
- Fixed Mount

Tracking:
- Global Positioning System (GPS) Modem
- Real-time location based logging

Data Analytics:
- Surface and Subsurface patterns
- High Resolution Spatially Distributed Data

##### Real-Time Water Flow Monitoring:
Water shortage is one of the most pressing issues in developing countries like Pakistan. Using the principle of Ultrasonic Range Finding the system is designed to continuously monitor water level and flow in irrigation canals, open channel drains and ponds or water bodies in real-time and be able to transmit data to the central server. The project further contains a server database where all the readings are recorded. The server is updated in real time as all devices from the network communicate with the server in real time. Afterwards, data is stored and mapped to various graphs and plots.

###### Water Flow Sensor
Features:
- Real time water level and flow monitoring
- Global Positioning System (GPS) Modem
- Real-time location based logging

Data Analytics:
- Daily, Weekly, Monthly and Yearly flow trends
- High Resolution data helping in identification of theft and/or leakages.  

#### Application
Real Time Monitoring of Water Level and Flows Irrigation canals, Open channel drains, Streams & Rivers, Pond or water bodies.
Assessment of Water Quality and Physicochemical parameters in water bodies.
Analysis of water in recycling and conservation applications, such as, rain water harvesting and ablution water reuse.

#### Impact on Principal Discipline of Research
The automation of water quality and water flow analysis is a key factor in the improvement of water resources and its management in countries throughout the world. The outcomes of this project will help create a path for the scientific research in areas of hydro informatics, water resource management, waste water and water management — that have been previously constrained in developing countries like Pakistan due to lack of accurate and usable data.

#### Impact on Solving Societal Problems
The irrigation canal flow monitoring system can significantly help in overcoming the problem of lack of usable data for proper and efficient management of the water demand and supply chain in the country. In addition, it can also create a significant impact in decreasing the agricultural water demand and can pave the path for revenue generation from irrigation users.
Moreover, in developing countries wastewater from various sources such as domestic sewage, untreated industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and animal waste is usually dumped into surface water streams. The collected data from the water quality monitoring system will help policymakers and decision-makers to identify key problem areas and design sustainability measures accordingly.

#### Impact on Solving Industrial Problems
By locally manufacturing and supplying the flow metering products and services, we believe we can provide the following value additions to both the interest of citizens and Government of Pakistan:
Less reliance and dependence on the foreign exchange.
Improved maintenance support and services due to availability of local resources.
Ability of providing the complete integrated solution according to the local capabilities and requirements.
Boost and encouragement of local engineering efforts at Pakistan.
Increased cost saving by utilizing local expertise and resources.

#### Impact on Development of Human Resource
The product outcomes of this research will help in emerging new entrepreneurial ventures in the area of water management technologies and will undoubtedly help in creation of new job markets and local employment opportunities.
