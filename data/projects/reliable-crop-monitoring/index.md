title: Reliable Crop Monitoring
tags: projects
layout: project
themes:
    - crop-monitoring
sponsor: Punjab Irrigation Department, Nestle
duration: 3 Years
concept: Pakistan’s economy is heavily dependent on agriculture. Any poverty alleviation effort in Pakistan should come coupled with reforms in agriculture sector. NARL along with WIT and other concerned departments at LUMS, is putting efforts to bring improvement in agriculture sector with the help of prior knowledge and modern techniques. Farm zone management through scientific approach is one of NARL’s aims. It also aims to educate farmer community with latest tools and techniques to closely monitor agricultural fields.

Agriculture constitutes the largest sector of Pakistan’s economy contributing about 25 percent of GDP. However, agricultural research in Pakistan is lagging in the use of modern technology to cope with new challenges of not only improving agriculture but also the livelihood of farmers.

National Agricultural Robotics Lab (NARL) is therefore, focusing on developing and deploying modern technology to monitor crop phenology closely and educating farmers with latest and eco-friendly technologies. Knowledge from agriculture experts is collected and disseminated accordingly with farmer community to for capacity building. Remote sensing through satellite & UAV is being used with different indices NDVI, EVI & NDWI to closely monitor agriculture fields and crop phenology.

Two major outcomes of the project include

- Khush-haal Kisan:
Khush-haal Kisan is an android application developed for farmers to improve crop management. The main purpose of the application is to provide farmers a tool which they can use to keep the tracks of their crops health, weather conditions and to make farmers aware of the paradoxical agriculture techniques. Another purpose of the application is to collect crop field samples from farmers.  
Satellite based health images provided every 5 days will help farmers to detect the weak crop location in the field very efficiently. They can keep track of the fields remotely. The seasonal time series charts will give the information about the condition of a field over time

- Development of season-wise Crop Data Layer for Punjab:
Season-wise crop data layer can be used by government organizations to estimate what, where and when certain crops are grown. Such information can be fed into models of supply and yield prediction, soil productivity, land use intensity, indicators of crop stress and damage from natural disasters, as well as monitoring general agricultural practices. Also, estimation of area and yield for major crops has been a major issue for government organizations.  
Remote Sensing based seasonal crop data layer can provide national authorities with improved agricultural statistics and crop production assessments. Crop classification using state of art deep learning techniques is being used to prepare crop data layer for the province of Punjab. Once prepared, we shall be able to report the area of major crops in Punjab even before harvest.
